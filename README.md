# Dropbox Explorer

Frustratingly, the Dropbox web interface doesn't allow you to see the sizes of folders. The only way to do this is to sync all your files locally and use your local file browser to get recursive directory information. This isn't very helpful if you're storing a lot of data and using Selective Sync locally to avoid having to download everything.

Dropbox Explorer is a simple Winforms app that uses the Dropbox API to query and aggregate this information.
